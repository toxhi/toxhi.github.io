project_title: "Non-Contact AI-Drowsiness Detection System for Safe Driving"

problem: |
  The proposed project aims to enhance highway safety by addressing the critical issue of driver drowsiness, a major factor contributing to accidents, severe crashes, and fatalities.

approach: |
  In this project, a range of research methods will be employed, including:
    -  image collection
    -  image and video analysis
    -  deep learning modeling. 
  Video feeds and images from cameras will be used to monitor the driver's eye movements providing real-time data on their state. Deep learning predictive models will be developed to:
    -  detect signs of drowsiness and
    -  trigger an alert when necessary
  The system will also incorporate continuous feedback to refine its accuracy and reliability over time.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result in:
    -  a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to identify signs of drowsiness in real-time by analyzing images and video data
    -  a real-time monitoring system using cameras to capture video feeds of the driver.
    -  an alert system that can notify the driver through audio cues when signs of drowsiness are detected.
