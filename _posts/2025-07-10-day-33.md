what_i_learned: |
 Today we had a writing workshop in the business building. What interested me most was the linguistics aspect, like how the length of english words doesn't make it any more complex to foreign speakers but rather the similarity. For example, Spanish speakers are more familiar with the words, "cerebral" and "altitude" because of their latin roots as opposed to the words "brain" and "volume". Since, I am currently learning another language, I find these facts to be very insightful and I feel like it opens me up to newer ways of thinking. I feel like we as English speakers are very biased towards our language.

I do like writing, but in the sense of creative avenues like journalling. When it comes to academic or research purposes, I like to write about the aspects im interested in.

After lunch, I ran efficentnet b4 using optuna. This will take incredibly long, probably over a day. I also made updates to the shared research paper.

 Ran into some errors in regards to importing tensorflow versions and dependencies which I was able to resolve. I found out that Optuna will take incredibly long to run, therefore I may only have enough time to train EfficientNetB4 only. 


reflection: |
 Today overall was a very informative day. Using Optuna to find the best parameters to use for my models is making the research interesting again cause before it just felt like I was arbitrarily testing out different hyperparameters but now it feels like im getting somewhere again. If time permits, I might even retry the lighter models to see if I receive similar or better results along with the heavier models B5-B7. I feel like I have much more to write in our paper now.
