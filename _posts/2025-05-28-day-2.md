what_i_learned:|
I met the faculty mentors and grad students that I will be working with and they explained our project. We will be working on a system that tracks eye movement in drivers to prevent sleep. We did a python workshop which was fun, and at the end we played the game Headband which was very engaging and interactive.

blockers: |
I had some issues setting up my website but they were resolved.

reflection: |
The python workshop was a great refresher and it got me re-invested in programming and data management.
