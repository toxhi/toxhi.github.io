what_i_learned: |
 my results for this trial of b4 were unusual: [[1077   41][ 586  387]]. I used adamw optimizer as well as signmoid and binary crossentropy and my results look more intentional but not promising enough. I got help from my teammates to debug errors and further optimize this model and rerun it. I reran the model for a fourth time using data augmentation, adamw, and a few other hyperparameters, and the confusion matrix was much more positive [[869 249]
 [401 572]] .



blockers: |
  training models on these computers takes too long, which limits how much progress I can make daily. 


reflection: |
 It feels as if I've hit a learning curve when it's come to optimizing the model. I've been needing alot more help lately running and testing the models to make sure everything goes smoothly. I also realized that im not as good with computers as i initially thought i was and then took the liberty of organizing my computer files, which in a way, helped me to understand file management better. Learning/Trying new things is the one thing that keeps me driven.
