what_i_learned: |
   Today I reviewed the Intro to Computer Vision course of Kaggle, which helped solidify my knowledge on Kernels, Max Pooling Layers and CNN architecture. I also caught up on two more literatures which I will be able to finish reviewing by next week Monday. Lastly my lab partners and I prepared a google slides presentation showcasing our research, progress, challenges and next steps.

blockers: |
   One of the course modules I worked on today requires training a model for 50 epochs, which took over an hour and even persisted through my lunch break.

reflection: |
   Today was a fun and productive day. I'm learning how to better manage my time and work in a team dynamic. By continously reviewing literature, I notice that I am able to grasp huge blocks of information quicker and extract the main points. I am also becoming more proficient at understanding matplotlib and its effectiveness at displaying images and data.
