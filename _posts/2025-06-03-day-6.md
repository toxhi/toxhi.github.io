what_i_learned: |
 I had to learn about the different types of neural networks like convolution, recurrent, random forest, svm as well as some mathematical operations such as matrices and hadamard products. In one of the papers I'm reading, the researcher explained the reason why the window size was 15 frames wide because that was the best number to get an accurate reading of whether or not the eyes were open or closed. The current research being done by my grad mentor so far largely resembles the literature he had us read. I now understand why the images in our dataset are 48x48. 


blockers: |
  The literature my grad mentor had me read was very dense. Understanding some methodologies took a long time and while I’ve learned alot there are still some concepts that I need to practice to get a more intuitive understanding like SVM and convolution. I had to google alot of the terms I wanted to know, and they were alot, but im slowly getting a feel of the content and im excited to learn more.



reflection: |
  I noticed that many of the papers address the same issue but propose slightly different methods to go about it. Like one camera proposed a system where the camera’s would be on the dashboard while another paper proposed a system where the camera would be on the glasses. However, they all rely on similar frameworks like cnns and svms. The methodologies and techniques were interesting and well thought out.  It's interesting to see how math comes into play and how data is managed and how decisions are being made. I learned more about the structure of a paper as well.
