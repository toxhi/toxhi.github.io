what_i_learned: |
   Today I researched MobileNet, one of the three models we will be employing in our research this summer. I learned about how it lowers computational cost through depth wise separable convolutions and is applied in much of the features we take for granted on our smartphones, such as object detection, facial recognition and augmented reality. I also attended a literature workshop hosted by my grad mentor, where I learned about the different methods of searching for literature online through scopus and the library database. This workshop helped me understand not only how to format a paper, but how to search for relevant information using specific queries and filters, as well as understand the publishing process of journals and conferences.


blockers: |
   researching mobilenet presented a lot of challenges, such as having to learn the mathematical principles governing convolution to gain a deeper understanding of the process. The model itself is multilayered and complicated but geeksforgeeks helps break it down.


reflection: |
   I appreciate the various resources on the internet such as geeksforgeeks and youtube that help demystify these concepts. The constant reading, repetition and surfing through the web, has helped me build my information gathering skills. Once you read enough articles you begin to see patterns and interrelationships between the concepts and source material, which I think is cool. Though it’s easy to go down a rabbit hole on sites like youtube, so I’ll try to stay focused on the relevant information.
