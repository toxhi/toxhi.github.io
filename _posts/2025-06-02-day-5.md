what_i_learned: |
 Today was the beginning of our inperson Ceamls program. We had an intro session where we were introduced to the program coordinators and informed about the nature of the remainder of our program. We also conducted a group exercise where we learned about the nature of AI research which I found informative due to the interactive nature of it, as we ourselves took upon the role of being data and artificial intelligence. Afterwards we had a fun competition to build a tower out of spaghetti, tape and a marshmallow. This enabled us to work as a team. After lunch we met with our grad mentor who explained to us the nature of our research and gave us the task to analyze and interpret the past literature on the google drive.

  Although I had completed the intro to deep learning course on Kaggle, reading the literature of our project introduced me to new terms that I do further investigation on, such as sampling error and generalization error. I found this information to be initially intimidating and overwhelming, but as I continue to read, I’m slowly beginning to understand and learn more about the research project.


reflection: |
  Overall, I found this first day to be really enriching. Being introduced to the large body of work being done in the field of computer vision and machine learning really showed me the importance of our work. I’m looking forward to these next few days!
