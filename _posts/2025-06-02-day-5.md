what_i_learned: |
 Today in our Python workshop we did exercises on File Input and Output. We ran various labs and collaborated through zoom to solve programming challenges which was enriching and helpful. Next, we were educated on generative ai and played around with various generative ai services, such as Suno.ai, a music generating software. We were also educated on Deep Learning and Machine Learning, and were quizzed through Kahoot, which was competitive and fun. Lastly, we played a game where we had to distinguish between real pictures and AI generated ones. Not going to lie, some tripped me up, which was hilarious but concerning.

blockers: |
  Learning to readlines through functions was a tricky tasks as well as managing that data through controlflow. 

reflection: |
  Today was a very enlightening and informative session. I gained a deeper understanding between the different terminologies in artificial intelligence and a newfound appreciation for computer technology.
