what_i_learned: |
  Today was our final day in the lab. We mostly made finishing edits to our research paper and worked on our presentation slides for tomorrow. Our grad mentor came in the afternoon to touch base with us on our progress on the paper and slides. We later recorded our demo videos of us trying out hugging face.

  NONE
reflection: |
  Tomorrow will be a big day. We won't know our time slot to present until then. I'm looking forward to the other project presentations, as well as watching the elevator pitches if they'll be presented. I learned alot in these past ten weeks.
