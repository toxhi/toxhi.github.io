what_i_learned: |
  Today was chill. I mainly helped set up the slides for this week's symposium. Our grad mentor came and reviewed our slides after lunch. We spent the time delegating who will speak over which slides as well as editing and proofreading them. Due to inclement weather, we left an hour early.

 Today was more fun, as we worked together to arrange our seperate findings. Our grad mentor is proud of you work and so am I. Tomorrow we will film our demo and do a practice run. I can't wait to present on Thursday.
