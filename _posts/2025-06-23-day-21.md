what_i_learned: |
  we had an impromptu meeting with the cohort this morning concering the symposium and paychecks. I got my v2b3 test results this morning and its pretty much on par with my initial v2b2 runs, not much improvement. I also had trouble setting up my virtual environment, whereby some of my labmates assisted me. We were able to create a local environment and access the local runtime through google colab.

blockers: |
  ive been lacking motivation lately. it feels like my research has hit a wall and there's no way I can further improve my models. ive also been dealing with alot of stress and burnout and its beginning to affect my productivity.


reflection: |
  I'm looking forward to the research symposium on Friday. In the coming days, I will inquire about my labmates progress more, and continue to running the heavier models like v2b4, and see if it will give me a higher accuracy. In the meantime, I will also catch up on rest. Additionally I will begin preparing some slides for the symposium.---
