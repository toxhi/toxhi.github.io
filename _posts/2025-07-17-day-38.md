what_i_learned: |  
  we had a writing workshop today. The part that interested me the most was about sportds betting and how much money it makes annually in the state of maryland ever since it was legalized. I didnt even know it was illegal before. My results for efficientnetb4 using the latest hyperparameters was very poor. I began training b5 with my optuna hyperparameters on this new dataset, and it should hopefully be done by the end of the day or tomorrow.

blockers: |
  I had to re-migrate the new dataset into my work pc because i realized that training models is easier there unlike my laptop. 

reflection: |
  I may run optuna using B4 over the weekend and if it finishes by then I will train b4 using whatever hyperparameters I get there and that will probably be my last training session for this program. If that finishes in time, I will train it on both old and new datasets and see what I got. I will also research more on batch normalization and develop the diagram for my current models to add to the research paper. Its all slowly coming together.
