what_i_learned: |  
  I was able to successfully train and save a model over the weekend to add to huggingface for real time detection. It turned out that model was too big to upload to hugging face so I had to re run another notebook which gave better results before and save that model using another name. This second model also uses the old dataset while the model I trained over the weekend used the old one. Lastly, I helped transfer some tables from our google docs to our overleaf template. 

  
blockers: |
  Running models on my laptop is much slower compared to running models on my work station. I still can't save models on my workstation due to errors.

  
reflection: |
  i noticed that the old dataset gave me better results. This may be biased but I was more diverse in skin color and ethnicity. The model is halfway done right now and should be done by tonight. Our symposium presentation is on Thursday and our slides are due Wednesday. Our paper is also due Friday. There's alot of work that we need to get done.
