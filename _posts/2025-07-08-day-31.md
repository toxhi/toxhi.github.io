what_i_learned: |
 today our grad mentor explained to us the meaning of an abstract and how it can be the first or last thing to write in a research paper depeding on the writers intention. We than began our reserach paper using google docs. For lunch, my whole research group and I wnet out to Ledo's pizza to unwind and get to know one another better, which was fun. We talked about alot from school and university to life in general.

blockers: |
 efficnetnnetb6 failed even after leaving the lab yesterday. i later found out that anything after b5 is too massive for my work gpu to handle, so i guess im done training larger models. The free version of overleaf only allows for 2 people max to edit at the same time so we opted for google docs for our research paper.


reflection: |
 Our plan is to finish our research paper by the end of the week. I've been tasked with assisting with the first part of the abstract as well as the methodology. We're nearing the end of this 10 week program. I'd say I've grown and learned alot and have a better understanding of myself and what motivates me.
