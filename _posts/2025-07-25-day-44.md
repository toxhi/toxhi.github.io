  We started off this morning with an impromptu speaker presentation. Dr. Chris Crawford introduced us to the growing field of Human/Brain Computing Interfacing through a slideshow presentation, which was incredibly informative. We later had a workshop session where we had to program miniature robots as well as drones to execute specific actions using a coding language similar to Scratch as well as EEG/EMG signals which were picked up through electrodes that were attached to our skin as well as a wearable headband respectively. This was the most fun activity we have done as a cohort so far. It was nice working together and sharing ideas and roles as to how to solve tasks and problems. I was designated as the "guinea pig" for the drone/headband session, which was hilarious.

  After lunch, we returned to our labs, where I compared the differences between results produced by using different optimizers in efficientnetb4, particularly Adam and AdamW. I also compared the differences between using different learning rates. The two main learning rates I used for B4 were 1e-4 and 5e-5, and for B5, I used a learning rate of 3.166037416245269e-05, which I obtained from running Optuna on B4.

  Looking through my notebooks has helped me create a sort of mental timeline of my entire work. Which I am proud of. Before I was afraid that I had lost track of my progress. I look forward to finishing the paper next week and have it reviewed by my grad mentor. I've come a long way.
