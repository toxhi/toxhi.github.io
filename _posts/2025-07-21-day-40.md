what_i_learned: |  
  Today began with an impromptu meeting in the business building with the entire SAIRI 2025 cohort. We were instructed on the order of the events for the remaining two weeks of the program, how to prepare our elevator pitch, and were informed to attend the end of the program recreational event to receive information about our final checks. We then proceeded with an overleaf tutorial. Prior to this week, my labmates and I struggled to utilize overleaf for our research paper due to the paywall that restricted more than 2 users to be making edits to the paper simultaneously, but it seems like the program paid for the lisence for each group, as well as pre-prepared templates for each project groups. We were then instructed how to make edits to the title of the paper, authors, as well as structuring the paper into seperate files to maintain an organized workflow. We also learned how to embed seperate files into the main paper, such as the .bib file, which contained bibtex for each of our references.

  I found the Overleaf workshop to be overall informative, and I am thankful to the SAIRI program for allowing us to access Overleaf for free, as it will enable us to expedite the process of completing the research paper. Before lunch, my labmates and I discussed how we will prepare our elevator pitch and so far we have come up with some pretty interesting ideas. Before the end of last week I tested one of my labmate's DenseNet models that contained suspicious results, and when I returned to the lab in the afternoon, I noticed that I obtained similar results. The confusion matrix was too perfect, and suggests overfitting. Additionally, As I took the time to view the week 8 presentations of the last two groups I hadn't checked, which were group 2 and 3, group 2 in particular intrigued me as they were utilizing some very complex programs, coding languages and architectures, like R, Mathlab and SPSS, the last of which I didn't even know of.---
