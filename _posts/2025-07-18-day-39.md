what_i_learned: |  
  I came in the lab and got dissapointing results for b5 on the new dataset. One of my labmates helped me point out some mistakes in my model. I forgot to add class weights, used the wrong otpimzer by mistake, and mislabeled some of my folders. I tried accessing my laptop GPU one last time and it seems like the most likely culprit is the fact that Im using a laptop rather than a desktop. After lunch, I helped make edits to the research paper and checked on the status of my model.

blockers: |
  while trying to detect my you on my laptop I ran into numerous bottlenecks

reflection: |
  Applying early stopping and ReduceLROnPlateau drastically reduces the time it takes to train models which I appreciate. Today is the last day we will be allowed to train models in the lab. Though we made alot of progress today, we have a long way to go when it comes to organizing our research paper. I may train one last model over the weekend, and then that's it.
