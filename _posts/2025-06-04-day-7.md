what_i_learned: |
 I learned about image dimensions, and how the third dimension determines whether the picture is grayscale, colored or has transparency. I also learned about the various attributes and functions found in python libraries like matplotlib and tensorflow such as plt.imshow, plot.show, .ndim, .flow_from_directory, ImageDataGenerator(), .ratio and so on. I refreshed myself about fitting models with supplemental information online and now have a better understanding of what makes a model overfitted or under fitted. Most notable was the learning about the confusion matrix, which I found useful in visualizing just how accurate the model is at classifying the data. 

blockers: |
 I had to research numerous terms and concepts in order to gain a deeper understanding of the research online. Though it took alot of time, I was incredibly helpful.

reflection: |
   It was fun learning about the various tools and resources available online and in journals at our disposal. I have a much greater appreciation of the usefulness of python in managing data. It's fun to learn new things, though sometimes I feel my Python fundamentals are lacking and try to revisit them every now and then. By brushing up on useful python terms, and rereading the codebase numerous time, I continuously gain a more intuitive understanding of not only the code itself but the problem were trying to solve.
