what_i_learned: |
  Today we began with a computer vision workshop where we were taught the basics of computer vision and its uses. We played around with teachable machine where we trained a model to recognize simple objects like water bottles and staplers. Additionally, we used Nvidia's YOLO model that recognized patterns and objects in videos and images instantly which was really cool. For our Icebreaker we played virtual Escape room where I had to learn to communicate effectively and clearly to my lab mates through zoom, as we were not allowed to share to the other players the contents of our screen. Lastly, we had a python workshop where we learned file input and output which was really fun and awesome. We learned how to create, read and write unto files using python code, which was incredibly useful.

  Teachable Machine had an issue where I had to refresh my browser in order to have the classes appear. It also utilized my camera, which prevented me from showing my face on zoom. I ran into an issue with visual studio code where I could not import Ultralytics from YOLO, but it worked on Google Colab. Also, I had a little difficulty grasping the syntax for file I/O but after some practice it became simple. 

reflection: |
  Overall, today was the most fun day. I gained invaluable skills and sharpened my programming and critical thinking skills.
