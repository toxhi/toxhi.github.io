  I checked my densenet121 results that i ran yesterday this morning. Though the results were pretty decent, my labmates pointed out something critical. I accidentally mixed the old dataset with the new one and the model ended up training on the combined datasets. What happened was that I mistakenly flowed images from the original database into the train, test and validation folders made from the new database that I tested with previously. Though unintentional, it was pretty cool. So far, my best trial contains efficientnet b5 trained using hyperparameters I obtained for running Optuna using b4, which was another mistake I did not notice until now. I also had to rerun this notebook because I did not apply model checkpoints which would've saved the model that I used unto my computer.

  In order to get the best visual of my graph, I had to run tf.keras.utils.plot_model(model, show_shapes=True), which requires downloading graphviz and pydot, but for some reason, !pip install graphviz and !pip install pydot do not work in my notebooks do not work so I had to install them manually. It didn't seem to work though, also my grad mentor told me however, that presenting a diagram of my efficientnet model will not be necessary, as we are focusing on the ensemble model in particular. I also faced issues re-running my best trial. I ended up borrowing a labmates notebook and swapped their model and learning rate for mines. I also made sure I was using the train, test and validation folders made from the original database. That didn't work, so I assumed that maybe its because im trying to save it in a specific location, so when I commented that out, and that didn't work either. So what I did was that I just removed checkpoint from the model.fit() entirely.

  I might train my b5 on the combined database later on for fun.
