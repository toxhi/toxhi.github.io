what_i_learned: |
  today I ran v2b2 once more, this time using the same parameters from my last successful run in order to recreate the same results, then try to improve the accuracy from there. I am simultaneously running v2b3 on the same computer. My grad mentor came in this morning and discussed how were going to prepare our weekly presentation as well as our mid-program presentation next week. Meanwhile, I organized the rest of my previous findings and worked on my presentation slide, as well as reviewed the confusion matrix and the equations associated with it to better interpret my results.

  not much


  reflection: |
So far, V2b2 performs the best. I hope to test v2b3 in the coming week and prepare for my mid summer presentation with my labmates. My lab partner showed me an easier way to save notebooks by using commands to convert them to pdf and html files. Overall this week was very productive.
