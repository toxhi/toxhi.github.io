what_i_learned: |
  yesterday's model finished training and I was able to compress it by removing the optimizer and upload it to hugging face. So far, the model provides mixed results. I helped update the metholodgy section with a brief description of EfficientNet and an explanation on learning rate and callback functions. Dr. Panday came to our lab and proofread our abstract. She gave really helpful feedback.

  NONE
reflection: |
  So far our paper's almost done. It mainly remains the discussion. We hope to be done with that by tomorrow and work on our slides. We'll probably have to do alot of rehearsing tomorrow. I'm excited for Thursday.
