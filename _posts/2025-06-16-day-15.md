what_i_learned: |
  I continued with the process of reinstalling tensorflow, cuda and cudnn to leverage my gpu on my personal computer with no success so far. However, my lab mate Aayam helped me access the GPU on my work PC. Mr Pelumi took my group on a tour of the cbeis building which was fun. 


blockers: |
  may have accidentally corrupted tensorflow when installing cuda and cudnn, which impacted my ability to run my model locally. I had to create a new python environment.

reflection: |
  Tomorrow, I will begin running efficientnevv2bo while changing the parameters to optimize it. Today's blockers gave me insight on how to download dependencies through command line interface and debugging. I also learned to ask for help and assist others, thus creating a more collaborative workspace. I'm learning to manage my time better, and take breaks when needed so as to not get too overwhelmed.
