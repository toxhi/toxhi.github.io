what_i_learned: |
Today I ran efficientnet b4 twice, first using 10 epochs, then again using 64 epochs. I also learned that efficientnet V2B4 does not exist, and that from this point on the larger models are just named B4-B7. I've been using mainly the Adam optimizer as I have no real reason to change optimizers. Unfortunately, the EfficientNetB4 did not finish by the end of my work hours so I will have to wait until I get home to see the results.



blockers: |
Though I began training B4 for 64 epochs in the morning, as of the afternoon it is only halfway done. It may not be done till the end of the day.



reflection: |
 This is the first time I've trained a model for this many epochs, and I wonder how it will turn out. I realized that I can only get so much done on my own so its nice to get help from my lab mates. The summer symposium has been delayed until July 3rd, giving us more time to train, collect data and present our findings so I plan on taking advantage of that. I will further train B5-B7 in the coming days.
