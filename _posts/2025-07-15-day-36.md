what_i_learned: |
  This morning we had an impromptu meeting where we learned about different modes of learning and differnet personality types by taking surveys. After lunch, I saw that my optuna had finished running. My best hyperparameters were a learning rate of 3.17e-5, Adam as my optimizer, and a dropout of 0.1. Im now training my b5 model based on these hyperparameters, which will hopefully be done by tomorrow. 

blockers: |
  I accidentally cleared some outputs by mistake but I feel like I already have the necessary information, but Michelle showed me how to check revision history to find cleared outputs. She also helped me to edit my codebase for training after using Optuna. I had to recite a source that I mistyped, as well as doublecheck that they are listed properly in the literature review and references sections of our paper.

reflection: |
  I had also previously attempted to run Optuna on a B4 model, but it did not finish. I will take the best trial of that model and use those parameters to train the B4 model after im done training the B5 model. After this, I may have time to try out Optuna at least once more for a smaller model before I have to begin putting my full focus on the paper. I did learn a little more about model checkpoints.
