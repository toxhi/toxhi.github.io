what_i_learned: |
 For today we finished editing our slides. Our grad mentor came and we did two practice runs. I later recorded my part of the demo vids in the afternoon. The rest of the day was spent merging the seperate recordings done my each group member together.

 none


reflection: |
 Today was mainly focused on preparation for the sympsium tomorrow. We received helpful feedback from our grad mentor and our high school student on composure and being cognizant of time constraints when presenting that we hope to implement on the stage tomorrow. I am excited for the symposium tomorrow. I can't wait to hear about the other research from the other groups.
