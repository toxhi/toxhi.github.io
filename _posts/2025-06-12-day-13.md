what_i_learned: |
  Today was the second day of our Cohort Connect, where we played Taboo, which helped us practice our communication and listening skills. Afterwards we played Genga, where we had to be very meticulous and methodical as to which block we had to remove and where to stack them to prevent the tower from falling on our turn. Afterwards I tried downloading CUDA and cudnn to help leverage my GPU for running the models locally, but it requires me to move certain files around, like .dlls, that I didn't feel comfortable moving at the moment, so in the meantime, I’ll just continue using my CPU for now, which is good enough. My lab partner helped me to download python and jupyter notebook on my work PC so I could run it locally there, which helped a whole lot. Two of my lab partners showed me similar results they got while running EfficientNet, which was reassuring. I later commenced rerunning mobilenetV2 and efficientnetV2B0, and I began finalizing my presentation of my research findings to my grad mentor for tomorrow.

  Organizing my data was difficult because I had to retrain my models over and over which was time consuming and made me lose track of some results. Comparing my results to my lab mates helped alot.

reflection: |
  I’ve been struggling lately with speaking up in group settings, not just in my lab but as a cohort as a whole. I tend to keep my thoughts and questions to myself because I’m afraid of saying something dumb, or coming off as pretentious, but honestly it becomes isolating. I’m still learning how to be more confident in my abilities, speak up more and share my thoughts and knowledge with others without guilt or shame. Even if I end up being wrong, at least I’ll know we're on the same page and I’m contributing in some way.
