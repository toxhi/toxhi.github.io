what_i_learned: |
 Today I went on a tour with the entirety of my research cohort around Morgan State. After having the format of the slides explained to us, I went on my lunch break. I then spent the rest of the day working on the Kaggle Computer vision course.


blockers: |
 Ive been having issues getting my second monitor to work. Luckily my lab mates and I were able to diagnose the problem and fix it.


reflection: |
   Today was less intensive than previous days, as half of it was spent on recreation. To be completely honest, I regret not leveraging this as an opportunity to destress as well as get to know the members of other research teams because I was not used to such large group settings. Next time, I’ll prepare questions such as: “How’s your research going?” and “What do you hope to learn from it?” to ask people in other research groups to break the ice, as well as seek out other people who seem quiet like myself. I want to be a better communicator and manage my time more wisely. Fixing my monitor with my lab mates was a nice bonding activity. It helped me realize the value of teamwork and collaboration.
