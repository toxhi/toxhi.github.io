what_i_learned: |
 i started off the morning by running efficientnet b5 for 64 epochs and batch size 32. Later that morning, our grad mentor popped in and explained mentioned that we will be having a writing workshop tomorrow and to prepare to write our literature review. So, after lunch, I practiced writing using overleaf, which was fun. I also learned to browse templates, as well as embed email links and line spacing. I ended the day by training b6 on my work pc before leaving.
 
blockers: |
 I had never used overleaf before but it is somewhat similar to html as well as the markdown language we use to write our blog posts. I initially ran out of resource allocation when training for b6 but that was because I had other sessions running locally so after closing those, the model continued training again.


reflection: |
 The b5 result wasnt that great. I think I might just settle at b4 and put my main focus on writing.  Overall, today was a quiet day, however, I'm looking forward to the literature session tomorrow. I'm excited to continue practicing overleaf.
