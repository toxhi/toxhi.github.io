what_i_learned: |
  Today,I re-ran my google colab notebooks to retry densenet121 and efficientnetB0 versions 1 and 2. Densenet 121 yielded results similar to its last run but the f1 score accuracy was low, only .5. I noticed that Densenet 121, though less efficient, took less time to run, even on CPU power. EfficientNet, on the other hand, took a very long time to run, though running it locally through VSCode made it faster.

blockers: |
  I was unable to continue using Colab’s backend GPU so I had to rely on the CPU, which was slow. While figuring out how to run the model locally I had to learn to navigate the command line interface. I had to work through multiple errors as I executed numerous commands and downloaded several dependencies.

reflection: |
  Asking for help is difficult because it always feels like at some point you’re supposed to know what to do, but I learned that it is okay to admit that you're stuck and ask informated questions than go through it alone. Communication is essential, even if you don’t feel like you have much to share, any input is still valuable. It’s easy to fall into the trap of perfection where you expect everything to be streamlined and work the first time but in reality it requires alot of trial and error. Obtaining worthwhile data is difficult and time consuming, but I figured out a practice of duplicating models to allow for multiple edits without making everything confusing. I hope to run these models locally later on in the day and test other models tomorrow.
