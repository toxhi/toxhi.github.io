what_i_learned: |  
  Had to help get metholodology ready for grad mentor by sharing some models and notebooks with my lab mates. I also researched on binary crossentropy and label smoothing, as well as the epsilon factor and callbacks we used, in order to incorporate it into the methodology. After lunch, our grad mentor took a look at the elevator pitch draft and liked it. He then mentioned that we will be having a meeting tomorrow to discuss the methodology and ensemble model.

  As I went through my notebooks to see which ones had the best accuracies, I had to re-update the names of notebooks in which I trained b5 using hyperparameters gotten using optuna on b4 by mistake, as well as the notebooks that did not use hyperparameter tuning. 
  
  
reflection: |
  The upcoming deadlines have made me notice some shortcomings in my research, the most recent being that I was not able to train b4 using its own optuna hyperparameters as well as the new dataset solely. Some of my older notebooks that produced great results did lack essential features that my newer notebooks have that could've led to a better presentation of information, such as a display of class and validation accuracy and model checkpoints, which probably made it more difficult for my teammates to include in the research paper. I also noticed that I forgot to save at times, leading to some of the notebook outputs being incomplete upon re-opening them, as well as the titles being inaccurate. I also notice that I need to communicate better with my labmates to get feedback and assistance and to share my ideas and experiences.
  Though the time for running models is essentially over, I might still run b4 with its own hyperparameters as well as use solely the new dataset for b5 and densenet121 just for learning purposes. Overall, I feel like this program as a whole has been very benefical towards my personal and professional development. I've seen massive improvements in my organizational, comprehension, analytical, reading and writing, discipline, time management, critical thinking, and communication skills, as well as overall expertise and confidence in research. Though our time together is slowly coming to a close, I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity and I look forward to adding it to my linkedIn and resume.
