what_i_learned: |
 I got my results for b4 this morning. Not much improvement.  Though I got a 99.96 training accuracy and 99.57 test accuracy%, the confusion matrix remains about the same [[595 523] [522 451]] Meaning of all the 2091 test images, only 595 were correctly predicted as drowsy, and 451 were correctly predicted as non drowsy, however, 523 were incorrectly predicted as drowsy but were actually non-drowsy and 522 images were incorrectly predicted as non drowsy but were actually drowsy. The precision and recall for drowsy images were the same, 0.53. Precision is the percentage of how many of the postively predicted images were actually correct, while recall is the percentage of how many of the actual positive values were correctly identified. This is the heaviest model I trained so far and it was for 64 epochs. Basically the greater the top left number and bottom left number are, the better the model is at predicting test data. In the meantime, I updated the metholodogy slide on our sympsium presentation.

  I found out that my head models were set up incorrectly likely attributing to the issue of the random guessing. I required the help from my peers in diagnosing the issue.


reflection: |
 I find it important to collaborate and get outside feedback when I’m feeling stuck. It keeps me engaged, helps me learn more, and relieves pressure. I am retraining the model now and hope and I'm looking forward to the results tomorrow. I will also try data augmentation in the training batches. I'm also looking forward to combining our models afterwards.
