what_i_learned: |
 I spent the morning making edits to the research paper. I also reviewed previous literature to grab further insights to add to the paper. I was able to include additional statistics further highlighting the importance of our research as well as update the literature review table. The rest of the day was spent reviewing literature.


blockers: |
 none


reflection: |
 i had to reread sections of my literatures multiple times in order to refresh my memory. Some of us had differing opinons as to how to construct the abstract, which took some time to sort out. Hopefully we should be done with the abstract and literature sections by tomorrow and move on to other parts of the paper. I look forward to the workshop tomorrow.
