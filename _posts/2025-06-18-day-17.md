what_i_learned: |
  I got my trial 3 efficientnetv1v2 results on my work pc from yesterday and the outcome was much poorer than I expected, likely due to removing some parameters that I previously added. I'll have to find out which parameters specifically cause that. Trial 1 for v2-b2, which has been running on my laptop since yesterday, still has similar settings, but so far, is yielding promising results, as the accuracy is increasing with each epoch, while the loss is drastically decreasing. I received the result, which were interesting and a much better improvement. There were alot more true positive and false negatives.


blockers: |
  im currently not allowed to move files in the shared google drive where all our work is housed, making it difficult to organize my findings. The confusion matrix for one of my models was very poor but I believe i found the issue. There was a lot wrong with my head model, for example, my dense layer was set to categorical classification instead of binary, and my loss was set to sparse categorical crossentropy so I set it to binary crossentropy. I hope these changes will improve the accuracy of my model. I also changed the activation of the head model from softmax to sigmoid and the value of the dense layer from 2 to 1. I applied these changes to trial 2 of v2b2 which will be running on my work PC.


reflection: |
  i noticed for my previous trials, the trial accuray and loss graph was smooth while the validation graphs were all over the place, but for efficientnetb2v2, bothe the training and validation accuracy and loss improved significantly. I also learned how to structure the architecture for the head of the model, as well as interpret the results of my model, such as the classification report, confusion matrix, and training history better. Organizing my results is still the hardest part of this all cause im still constantly switching between computers, but saving on google drive helps mitigate the confusion. I'm looking forward to trial 2's results tomorrow.
