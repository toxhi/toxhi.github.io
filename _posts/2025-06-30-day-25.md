what_i_learned: |
 the 5th trial for B4 that i ran last friday before leaving the lab yielded amazing results. The confusion matrix was [[788 330] [365 608]]. I reviewed two videos from last weeks submissions, and noted the similarities and differences in our metholodology and blockers. I also found drawing in between work tasks to very stress-relieving. After lunch, I watched a video on how to use Optuna to rerach for the best hyperparameters for my model, as well as discussed with my teammates how we will be recording our demos. We spent the last few hours working on our slides and adding the necessary information.

blockers: |
 Formatting the slides were a bit challenging as I had to condense as much information as possible within a few slides.


reflection: |
 I feel like this week will be less training and more preparation for our presentation, however, I sent a notebook to a lab partner who will he running it on his GPU, which should be much faster. I hope that it will be done before our presentation, though that may be unlikely. During the process of making the slides, I had to reference back to past slides detailing accomplishments and challenges and it reminded me just how much work I put on over the past several weeks and how far I've come in this research, which made me proud of myself. I'm now more excited to present on Thursday.
