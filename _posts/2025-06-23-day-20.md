what_i_learned: |
  So today I ran v2b2 one last time, this time using sigmoid and binary crossentropy as opposed to softmax function and sparse categorical crossentropy. In the meantime, I reviewd the video presentations made by the other groups of our cohort last week. I really enjoyed listening to the ai driven flight model project as it delved into machine learning and database management. My v2b2 trail 4 results came up undesirable, with low test and training accuracy.


blockers: |
  My computer restarted automatically when I was running v2b3 :(


  reflection: |
  I will restart testing v3b2, and hopefully compile my work and begin rehearsing our mid-summer symposium presentation with my lab mates.
