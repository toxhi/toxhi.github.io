what_i_learned: |
  I came back to the lab this morning to see that my optuna was still up and running, thankfully. As of now it is on the 25th trial and should be hopefully done by tomorrow morning or afternoon. I reviewed and responded to two weekly videos. The proactive defense system especially interested me. After lunch I also reviewed the outline for the research paper and made an update. My grad mentor came in at the end of the day and according to him, this will be the last week to run models, and that the week after will be only for writing the paper.

blockers: |
 optuna training has taken over 76 hours so far. I may only have time to train one more model.


reflection: |
 I simultaneously rewran b5 over the weekend using optuna on my computer. Upon studying the logs for optuna, i found out that my accuracy was not improving and that suggessting that model wasn't learning beyond chance. Training and validation loss were ~0.6907 consistently. a matter of fact, i later found out that using any models heavier thaan b2 was considere overkill considering how small the dataset is. val_loss: 0.6907, val_accuracy: 0.5348 was the best result consistently. I think ill go back to the simpler models.
