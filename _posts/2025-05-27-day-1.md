what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the beginning of my internship with ceamls. We had a speednetworking session where we learned about the other participants which was hectic but engaging. I had to learn to speak up more and give others a chance to speak to communicate more effectively. We then moved on to into workshops on git and github. Afterwards, we played Jeoparday which was competitive but lighthearted. Lastly, we began desiging our websites using Github. It was alot of fun.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  Learning about Git and Github was fun. I had a great time learning about others.
