what_i_learned: |
 The long awaited symposim finally arrived. The 14 research groups, mine incuded presented our findings throughout the entire day in the business building auditorium at Morgan State. Many of the presenatations were really engaging, and I took away alot from them. Lunch was also served.
 
blockers: |
 I wasn't used to public speaking so I was initially nervous, but when it was my turn to speak, I did much better than i expected.


reflection: |
 It feels good presenting the work you produced over the course of five weeks. I'm proud of myself and my team for our accomplishments. By trying to stay engaged and attentive, I developed greater listening and comprehension skills. Through by the end of the day I was extremely exhausted.
