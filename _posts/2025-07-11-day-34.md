what_i_learned: |
  Upon entering the lab this morning, I found out that my computer turned off overnight and was unable to finish running optuna. I had to reboot it and start over. Now im rerunning optuna but this time with EfficientNetB5. In the meantime, I made some updates to the research paper.

blockers: |
 computer restart


reflection: |
 Today was really stressful. Having to start afresh was a major setback. I think our team dynamic also needs work. Hopefully next week will be better.
