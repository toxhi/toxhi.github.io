what_i_learned: |
  I began running efficientnetv2bo. I compiled my current findings on the models I trained. Our grad mentor came in and explained to us the next steps for next week.. After lunch, my lab mates and I worked on our weekly presentation. Towards the end of the day, I received the Efficientnetv2 results, which outperformed all the other models I trained thus far.

blockers: |
  none

reflection: |
  My grad mentor assigned each of us to a particular model to do further analysis and experimentation on. Lately my result for the previous models had me feeling down, but efficientnetv2's performance has gotten me more excited. I hope to adjust its parameters like epoch and batch size and optimize it better to get a more favorable result in the confusion matrix. I'm excited for next week.
