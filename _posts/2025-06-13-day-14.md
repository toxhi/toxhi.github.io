what_i_learned: |
  I began running efficientnetv2bo. I compiled my findings on the three models I was supposed to train. Our grad mentor came in and explained to us the next steps. After lunch, we made a weekly presentation.

blockers: |
  none

reflection: |
  Even though I know I do work I never feel like presenting it because it feels redundant. I no longer see the point in inflating tiny accomplishments. I just want to see if experimenting with the models makes an actual difference in accuracy and test scores.
